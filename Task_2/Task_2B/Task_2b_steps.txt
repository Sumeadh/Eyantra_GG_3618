Please write the complete steps taken by your team explaining how you completed Task 2B. It is adviced to be as elaborate as possible.

1. In order to evaluate the given images, we have decided to use ResNet50 model and its weights.
2. Before the training of the model we have used data augmentation steps like RandomHorizontalFlip, RandomGrayScale.
3. As part of the preprocessing steps we have converted the image to size of (224, 224), and normalized it to the parameters given in the pytorch documentation
4. We have imported the ResNet50 model from torchvision.models library
5. The final layer is modified to produce 5 output features. Requires_grad is set to false to freeze the previous layers in place.
6. We have used CrossEntropyLoss() as our loss function and Adam optimizer as optimizer function.
7. The dataloader is then fed into the layer for training. We train in for 5 epochs with a learning rate of 0.01
8.
