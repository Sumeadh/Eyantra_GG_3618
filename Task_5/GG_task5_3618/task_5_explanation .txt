Task 5A Documentation

Image Processing:
	Using Perspective transformation technique we transformed the skewd image into a flattened one. 
	This eases out the event detection avoiding unwanted jitterings which we faced during contour detection methods available in the python file uploaded

Event Detection
	Used resnet 152 for the ml model which enhanced event classification 
	After detecting the event we printed out the detected event on top of the image using opencv, can't upload the model file due to payload being too large and the modelsize is big

Line Following Algorithm
	The crux of the algorithm is such that the bot turns left and right contantly and if any of the sensor detects black, then it turns in the opposite direction.
	The third sensor(center sensor) is used to follow the middle line and node detections.
	We are planning to enhance the speed by using 5 sensors in the upcoming tasks

Path planning algorithms 
	We have successfully implemented the djkstra's alorithm for path planning
	Additionally we used vector concepts to communicate on how the car should be turned in-order to move to it's subsequent node
