Please write the complete steps taken by your team explaining how you completed Task 2C. It is adviced to be as elaborate as possible.

1. We first extracted the event images from the arena by hardcoding the locations of the images. 
2. Since the location of the event images is fixed, we found out the exact starting pixel location of the events with the help of
a image editing sotware like photoshop.
3. Alternatively we can also try to use opencv functions to detect contours with an approximate size of 2500 pixels
4. We then used the training weights from task_2c_model_training.py to classify the extracted images.
5. The training file that we used is the same as the one we used in task_2b with a small change. We have experimented with learning rate
scheduler in this one
6. The detected image is returned as an integer by the model. So we have encoded it to the given variable names using a detect() function.
